# Mini-project: Miscellaneous | Crowdsourced Contribution

Primary skills/categories targeted:

- Assessed: Any, depending on topic of responses
- Unassessed: 2, 3, 4

**Note:** This is an exception to the rule that you can only get one point per objective per assignment. **Depending on the quantity and quality of the contributions you make, you can earn up to 3 points for Unassessed Objective #3**: “follow a debugging workflow with independent and collaborative strategies.” In the context of this assignment, being an active contributor to solving others’ problems meets this objective (vs the processes you use to solve your own problems). UO#3 is the only exception; all other objectives still follow the 1-pt-per-objective rule.

## Description

This “project” isn’t much of a project, it just is what it is.

Contribute knowledge or help to a crowd-sourcing support page, like stack overflow or an R-focused subreddit.

Show that you’ve done so with screenshots, then include in your assessment doc:

1. A summary of the question(s) you responded to and the response(s) you gave
2. Some kind of reflection
3. Check off any assessed or unassessed skills that you actually demonstrated in your contribution (e.g., if you helped fix some tidyverse code, check off the relevant tidyverse skills

## Submission

1. Copy the `assessment.md` doc from your top-level directory into this project subdirectory.
2. Complete the assessment document.
    1. See note at the top of this document for a note about earning multiple points for Unassessed Objective 3. If you believe you've earned multiple points (maximum 3) based on the quality and/or quantity of your contributions, include a note in your assessment explaining why.
3. On Canvas, go to the next available open mini-project assignment. In the text box, include:
    1. The name of the project and/or a brief description of the project
    2. A link to the subdirectory for your mini-project
        1. If you completed the project in a separate repository, your `assessment.md` file in the subdirectory should explain how to access your work.
    3. Any additional info you'd like your grader to know
4. Submit the Canvas assignment. Your grader will access the directory you've linked to, grade your work on the assessment doc, push the doc back to your repository, and mark your Canvas assignment as complete.
