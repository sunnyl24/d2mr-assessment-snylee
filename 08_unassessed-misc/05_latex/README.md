# Mini-project: Miscellaneous | LaTeX

Primary skills/categories targeted:

- Assessed: None specifically, but can potentially hit 20-30
- Unassessed: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

## Description

In this project, you will create one or more documents that use LaTeX to render specified and customizable text.

LaTeX (pronounced ”lah-tek” or “lay-tek”) is fully “off-the-syllabus,” so it will be up to you to learn and apply the basics you need. Two class topics — Quarto and BibTeX — are closely interrelated with LaTeX, and can be useful starting points.

## Instructions

This project is intended to be extremely open-ended. The instructions and approaches in this document are truly just suggestions. Chances are that if you’re considering completing this project, you already have an inkling of where and how you may want to apply LaTeX skills. Please use this as an opportunity to follow that path rather than conforming to the suggestions here!

If you are fully new to LaTeX, take some time to familiarize yourself with some basics before diving in.

I recommend starting with the [Learn LaTeX in 30 Minutes](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes) tutorial from [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/learn) (an online editor).

Additional resources are included below.

## Suggested Approaches

- Create a mock research paper that requires mathematical notation
- Design a methods or results section featuring statistical equations
- Reproduce a document created with apaquarto using LaTeX formatting you defined yourself (i.e. look at apaquarto’s inner workings to see what LaTeX should look like, then use that as a template for what the form of your original styling)
- Design a statistical cheat sheet with common formulas
- Build a presentation template for quantitative research in your subfield
- Develop a methods section template for future use
- Recreate a product from a different project (e.g., a class demo) using LaTeX

You can keep your LaTeX learning contained within RStudio, or you can opt to branch out. I suggest starting with [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), a fantastic LaTeX editor growing in popularity.

## Submission

1. Copy the `assessment.md` doc from your top-level directory into this project subdirectory.
2. Complete the assessment document.
3. On Canvas, go to the next available open mini-project assignment. In the text box, include:
    1. The name of the project and/or a brief description of the project
    2. A link to the subdirectory for your mini-project
        1. If you completed the project in a separate repository, your `assessment.md` file in the subdirectory should explain how to access your work.
    3. Any additional info you'd like your grader to know
4. Submit the Canvas assignment. Your grader will access the directory you've linked to, grade your work on the assessment doc, push the doc back to your repository, and mark your Canvas assignment as complete.
