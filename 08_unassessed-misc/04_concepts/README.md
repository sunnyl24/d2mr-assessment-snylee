# Mini-project: Miscellaneous | Communicating concepts

Primary skills/categories targeted:

- Unassessed: 11-16

This project is primarily intended for you to demonstrate unassessed conceptual skills, but you can incorporate assessed skills if desired.

## Description

This very open-ended project gives you a chance to demonstrate your understanding of R programming and data workflow concepts in a format of your choice. The goal is to explain these concepts in your own words, showing how they connect and why they matter for research in psychology (or your field).

You are welcome to make this project as simple or in-depth as you like. Feel free to use it to just submit a few paragraphs talking through concepts if you just want to earn a few point, or turn it into a ambitious project that not only demonstrates conceptual knowledge but also learning objectives of data communication, programming, tidyverse, or any other course material.

## Instructions

There are no guided instructions for this project. It is intended to allow you to focus attention on what you find most important and present your knowledge in a way most useful to you.

You can explore the topics more interesting to you, but as a reminder here are the conceptual skills listed in the learning objectives:

1. explain and apply the “grammar of graphics”
2. name and differentiate R data types
3. name and differentiate R objects
4. define “tidy” data and explain its advantages and disadvantages
5. recognize and interpret common data visualizations
6. determine most appropriate visualizations and analyses for specific research questions and data

Additionally, consider exploring concepts covered in class, such as:

- Workflow with GitHub and RStudio
- Fundamentals of R programming
- Integration of tidyverse packages
- Best practices for data visualization
- Best practices for conducting and interpreting statistical analyses with R (specifically geared toward psychologists/social scientists)
- Purpose, advantages, and limitations of a writing workflow using Quarto notebooks, including best practices for code chunks and markdown
- Essential practices and purposes of a reproducible workflow
- Debugging and documentation

## Ideas for Possible Approaches

These are just some ideas to get you started! Your work does not need to take this format.

1. **Tutorial Series**
    - Create a series of blog-style posts teaching a specific R workflow
    - Include code examples, explanations, and real-world applications
    - Could focus on a particular research scenario from start to finish
2. **Visual Guide**
    - Design flowcharts or infographics showing how different R concepts connect
    - Create annotated screenshots of code and output
    - Develop visual metaphors to explain complex concepts
3. **Case Study Analysis**
    - Take a published psychology paper and explain how you would reproduce it using R, with a focus on the concepts rather than the literal steps or code
    - Break down and explain the workflow steps needed
    - Highlight where specific R skills would be useful and why
4. **Concept Map**
    - Create an interactive or static map showing relationships between R concepts
    - Explain how different tools and packages work together
    - Show the flow from raw data to final manuscript

## Submission

1. Copy the `assessment.md` doc from your top-level directory into this project subdirectory.
2. Complete the assessment document.
3. On Canvas, go to the next available open mini-project assignment. In the text box, include:
    1. The name of the project and/or a brief description of the project
    2. A link to the subdirectory for your mini-project
        1. If you completed the project in a separate repository, your `assessment.md` file in the subdirectory should explain how to access your work.
        2. Given the open-ended nature of this mini-project, I encourage you to  consider an alternate format to a simple .qmd in the subdirectory or a separate repo.
    3. Any additional info you'd like your grader to know
4. Submit the Canvas assignment. Your grader will access the directory you've linked to, grade your work on the assessment doc, push the doc back to your repository, and mark your Canvas assignment as complete.
