# Mini-project: Miscellaneous | Create a Tutorial

Primary skills/categories targeted:

- Unassessed: 1, 2, 3, 11-16

This project is primarily intended for you to demonstrate unassessed conceptual skills and off-the-syllabus skills, but by its nature you will almost certainly incorporate multiple assessed skills relevant to your topic.

## Description

In this project you will create a tutorial on any topic related to R programming, data workflows, or research communication that interests you. The goal is to effectively explain technical concepts to a specific audience of your choosing, 
while demonstrating your own understanding of the material.

## Instructions

Create a tutorial in any format that effectively teaches a concept or skill related to the course material. You have complete freedom in choosing:

- Your topic
- Your target audience
- Your presentation format
- Your level of technical depth
- Which course concepts to incorporate

You are welcome to choose a topic off the syllabus, as long as it clearly extends from the syllabus material. As a rule of thumb, if you can demonstrate a few assessed objectives in the process of demonstrating your OtS skills, it’s probably a close enough topic. Check with Dr. Dowling if you are unsure.

## Required Introduction Elements

Whatever format your tutorial takes, it should begin with an introduction orienting your readers (in particular your graders!) to the tutorial’s design. The introduction should include:

- Clear identification of the target audience
- Concise description of the tutorial’s topic and scope
- Learning objectives or goals (not the ones you’re trying to get points for, the things you want your hypothetical reader to learn from your tutorial)

## Recommended Additional Elements

- Applied examples (code chunks, plots, screenshots, etc.)
- Conceptual, plain-English explanations
- Practice exercises or challenges
- Resources for further learning
- Discussion of common pitfalls or misconceptions

### Audience Selection

Unlike the “class demo” mini-project where your intended audience is other D2MR students, you can gear your tutorial towards any audience you like. For example, instead of your peers you could consider one of the following audiences:

- High school students in their first programming class
- Members of industry transitioning into academia (or the reverse)
- Experienced Python users new to R
- Expert R users new to Quarto
- Collaborators on a project who need narrow-scope support

### Ideas for Possible Topics

These are just suggestions to spark your creativity:

1. **Technical Skills**
    1. Advanced ggplot2 techniques for specific visualization needs
    2. Efficient data cleaning workflows for messy psychological* data
    3. Creating custom functions for common research tasks
    4. Git/GitHub workflows for research teams
2. **Research Applications**
    1. Implementing specific statistical analyses in R
    2. Reproducible workflows for longitudinal studies
    3. Data visualization best practices for specific types of psychological* data
    4. Automating routine research tasks
3. **Communication Focus**
    1. Creating publication-ready tables or plots in R
    2. Building effective psychology* research presentations with R
    3. Writing reproducible manuscripts
    4. Sharing research data and code effectively

*Or another social sciences or STEM field.

## Format Options

Consider formats such as:

- Blog post or article
- Interactive notebook
- Presentation
- Simple website (hosted or not)
- Workshop materials
- Reference guide
- Cheat sheet

Remember that Quarto is designed for a lot more than we use it for in this class! It has many publishing options, including formats suitable for many of the above.

## Submission

1. Copy the `assessment.md` doc from your top-level directory into this project subdirectory.
2. Complete the assessment document.
    1. The design of this project also invites you to develop and demonstrate off-the-syllabus skills. Remember that 20 of the 50 mini-projects points can be gained by unassessed and OtS skills (as well as assessed skills). Be sure to outline the skills you learn and demonstrate clearly in your assessment document to get full credit.
3. On Canvas, go to the next available open mini-project assignment. In the text box, include:
    1. The name of the project: “Create a tutorial”
    2. A link to the subdirectory for your mini-project
        1. If you completed the project in a separate repository or another non-repository format, your `assessment.md` file in the subdirectory should explain how to access your work.
        2. Given the open-ended nature of this mini-project, I encourage you to  consider an alternate format to a simple .qmd in the subdirectory or a separate repo.
    3. Any additional info you'd like your grader to know
4. Submit the Canvas assignment. Your grader will access the directory you've linked to, grade your work on the assessment doc, push the doc back to your repository, and mark your Canvas assignment as complete.
