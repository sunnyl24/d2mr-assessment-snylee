# Mini-project: Miscellaneous | Debugging journal

Primary skills/categories targeted:

- Unassessed: 1, 2, 3, 4

This project is primarily intended to address unassessed learning objectives, but you are welcome to approach the project in a format that allows you to demonstrate assessed objectives as well.

## Description

This open-ended project gives you an opportunity to demonstrate 
your troubleshooting and debugging skills developed throughout the 
course. Document and reflect on your problem-solving experiences, 
showing how you approach, investigate, and resolve coding challenges in 
R.

## Instructions

In the format of your choosing (I use “journal” loosely), document your approach to troubleshooting and debugging throughout the quarter (or over a few weeks). Reflect on common patterns in problems you encounter, the steps you take to solve them, and how either or both change over time as you gain experience.

## Suggested Elements

Your journal (or whatever) might include:

- Examples and explanations of error messages you've encountered
- Documentation of debugging tools and strategies, including those that have been ineffective
- Examples of specific problems (not just errors) you’ve encountered and the solutions you’ve devised
- Reflection on your learning process
- Favorite (or least favorite) resources or approaches discovered
- Points of agreement or disagreement with “best practices”

## Format

Choose any format that works for you:

- Case study collection
- Personal debugging guide
- Problem-solving narrative
- Interactive troubleshooting map
- Just a straight up journal or other record-keeping
- Something else! Really this is anything you want

## Submission

1. Copy the `assessment.md` doc from your top-level directory into this project subdirectory.
2. Complete the assessment document.
3. On Canvas, go to the next available open mini-project assignment. In the text box, include:
    1. The name of the project: “Debugging journal”
    2. A link to the subdirectory for your mini-project
        1. If you completed the project in a separate repository, your `assessment.md` file in the subdirectory should explain how to access your work.
    3. Any additional info you'd like your grader to know
4. Submit the Canvas assignment. Your grader will access the directory you've linked to, grade your work on the assessment doc, push the doc back to your repository, and mark your Canvas assignment as complete.
