# Mini-project: Data Communication | Topic Demo

Primary skills/categories targeted:

- Assessed: depends on the chosen topic, but in all cases 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 29
- Unassessed: 1, 5, 10, any of 11-16 depending on topic

## Description

In this project you will create a Quarto notebook that demonstrates and 
teaches a core concept from our course curriculum, or an “off-the-syllabus” skill relevant to the course. 

You do not need to share your notebook with other students, but you should design the demo with your classmates as the intended audience, as though you were going to step in to lead class for a day.

That said, if you are proud of your work and would like to share it with others, please do! 

## Instructions

1. Choose one core topic from the course curriculum, such as:
    - Data wrangling with tidyverse
    - Data visualization with ggplot2
    - Creating tables with gt/gtExtras/kable
    - Working with Git/GitHub
    - Citation management with BibTeX
    - Statistical analysis in R
    - OtS skills are ok too as long as you can use the demo to show *on*-the-syllabus skills too
2. Create a Quarto notebook (.qmd) that includes:
    1. YAML header (minimally with a title and output format)
    2. Introduction to the topic
    3. Sensible logical organization
    4. Effective use of markdown for presentation
    5. Textual (i.e., in the markdown) explanations of concepts
    6. Code chunks with examples
3. Successfully render your notebook to HTML format with a cohesive visual style
    1. Be sure your demo would run for a hypothetical student (use relative paths!)

## Challenge suggestions

Extend your project with these optional enhancements:

1. Convert your notebook into an alternative format, like Quarto presentation slides, a simple Quarto website (not necessarily published; RStudio can render a full website locally!), or an APA-formatted document.
2. Make your demo/lesson more engaging by including interactive elements like embedded videos/animations, Shiny interaction, and html & css styling.
3. Create a companion GitHub repository with README documentation, example data files, etc.
4. Instead of a “walkthrough” style demo, create a “guided exercise” style demo, like the leveled data cleaning, wrangling, and visualization projects. If you go this route, you should include both the student version (without code/answers) and the instructor version (the key with working code and answers).
5. Develop complementary materials, like a cheat sheet or reference table.

## Submission

1. Copy the `assessment.md` doc from your top-level directory into this project subdirectory.
2. Complete the assessment document.
3. Add any relevant or necessary files to the directory where your demo notebook is contained, e.g., any example data, sourced scripts, or rendered output. Be sure your .gitignore does not prevent these from pushing to github!
4. On Canvas, go to the next available open mini-project assignment. In the text box, include:
    1. The name of the project and/or a brief description of the project
    2. A link to the subdirectory for your mini-project
        1. If you completed the project in a separate repository, your `assessment.md` file in the subdirectory should explain how to access your work.
    3. Any additional info you'd like your grader to know
5. Submit the Canvas assignment. Your grader will access the directory you've linked to, grade your work on the assessment doc, push the doc back to your repository, and mark your Canvas assignment as complete.
